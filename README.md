# A*

An Implementation of the A* Shorted Path Algorithm in Java.

A* is an optimized version of Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm. It uses a heuristic that narrows the number of explored vertices, resulting in better performance.

Includes a general-purpose library for A* and a demo on an 800x800 grid of tiles.
The library can also perform standard Dijkstra's Algorithm.
